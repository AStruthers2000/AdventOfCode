# Advent Of Code
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

In 2022 I used Python to solve some of the challenges. As of 2023, I have gone back and started attempting the 2022 challenges in C++, as a warm-up exercise. I will be attempting the 2023 challenges in C++.
